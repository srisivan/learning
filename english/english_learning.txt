Topics covered : Chapter 1 - 'The gift of Magi'
			     -It is a short story by O.Henry.
				 -It talks about love and sharing between one couple Della and Jim.
				 -The story is set at the time of christmas eve,which is the time to share gifts.
				 -The couple give up the precious posseions in need to gift one another.
				 -Della sold her precious hair in need to buy a platinum for for Jim;
				 -Jim sold his golden watch in need to gift Della.
				 -The story creates the following emotions in me:
					  -Happy : Although the gifts weren't of any use for the couple Jim didn't care at all.He was happy about Della for her caring and love.
					  -Sad   : The couple lost all their precious posseions in order to buy gift to each other;but it was not of any use to them.
				 -This story inspires me to go and read other short stories by O.Henry.
