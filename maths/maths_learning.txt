Date : 30-5-16
--------------
Topics covered :
	1: A word problem.
	2: Filling blanks using integers with properties.
	3: Verifing values 'a' and 'b' with the formula a-(-b) = a + b
		- such as, 'a' = 100 and 'b' = 200,when the formula applied becomes,
				*100 - ( - 200 ) = 100 + 200.
			    *100 - ( - 200 ) = 300,
				*100 + 200 = 300. 300 = 300
	       	~ Therefore the property satisafies the case.
	4: Satisafying greater( > ) or smaller( < ) or equal with integers.

	2: whole numbers 
	3: integers

	Integers
	--------
	- Integers are whole numbers, including +ve, -ve and zero natural numbers
	- Integers are denoted by Z
	  Example : -4, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4
	- On number line, if we move towards right, value increases
	- On number line, if we move towards left, value decreases
	  Example : 4 > 3, -4 < -3
	- All -ve numbers are less than zero
	- All +ve numbers are greater than zero
	- Zero is neither -ve nor +ve
	- Absolute value of number, it is distance between 0 and number, irrespective of sign
	  Example -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3 (Disatance between 0, 2 is 2 and 0, -2 is also 2)
	- Absolute value of number n is written |n| 
	  Example |3| is 3 and |-3| is 3

	Whole Numbers
	-------------
	- Whole numbers are +ve numbers including zero. They do not include any decimal or fractional part
	- Whole number are denoted by N

	Natural Numbers
	---------------
	- Numbers that appear naturally and commonly in nature
	- Natural numbers include {0, 1, 2, ...}
