Topics : about thermometer
			 1: parts of a thermometer
				- a bulb
				- the stem
				-capillary tube.
			 2: the reason mercury is used :
				-it can be seen through the glass,but water cannot.
				it does not stick to any surface.
			 3: the reason alcohol is used in very cold placesb:
				-it's boiling point is below than the boiling point of water
